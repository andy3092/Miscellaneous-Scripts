## reclassify.py

A simple script to reclassify a raster dataset using gdal and numpy.
Orginally the script was used to see how gadal and numpy can be used together.
Then it was tested pitting a pentium 233 with 256 MB against ArcGIS 10 on a Dell
T3500 work station with 16GB of memory. The pentium 233 came out on top. Mainly
due to the fact ArcGIS had to collect a license for the Arcpy module.
